DIXEL NFT 

This a Dapp that allows you to mint a randomly generated Dixel from 78 unique traits.
You can stake your NFTs to earn Starm as a reward. The rarity and the level of your Dixel will greatly influence the velocity of starm production.
Starm can be spent:
- to level up your Dixels.
- to buy lottery tickets to maybe win the right to mint a Dixel for free, transactions costs at your expense.

//Feature coming up: buy other Dixels for starm on our native Dixel marketplace
 
 THE LOTTERY :

 The lottery can be entered by buying lottery tickets,with Starm, and then registering chosen spots in the lottery. The more tickets you buy, the more your odds of wining go up !!
 => Lottery rewards:
   - Earn a ticket to mint a Dixel for free !! (Transactions costs are at the user's expanse)
   - Earn Starm to level up your Dixel or to enter Lottery again and try your luck!

THE MARKETPLACE (upcoming):
- Buy and sell Dixels for Starm or ETH ! 

THE DIXELS:

   - Uniquely generated from over 78 possible traits.
   - There are 4 levels of rarity from common, uncommon, rare to legendary. Its rarity greatly influences Starm generation.
   - The rarity of a Dixel is based on the sum of the rarity of each traits it is composed of.
   - A Dixel can be level up, upgrading its starm generation capabilities and modifying its appearance !!
     => The last level is called "Collector" and only 200 Dixels can be transformed into collectors !
